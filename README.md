# Wiki
since I need to redo given processes/installations/commands I put together this wiki. It should help finding information and useful commands for used tools and the following: instructions,hacks,hints,installs,reinstall informations, experiences

[check out the wiki here](https://github.com/MichiMich/Wiki/wiki)
I will put in all my learned instructions for getting things running, needed installations, reinstallations and so on
